QUESTION 1
The current year and the year in which the employee
joined the organization are entered through the keyboard. If the
number of years for which the employee has served the organization is
greater than 3, then a bonus of Rs. 2500/- is given to the employee. If
the years of service are not greater than 3, then the program should do
nothing


# include <stdio.h>
int main( )
{
int bonus, cy, yoj, yos ;
printf ( "Enter current year and year of joining " ) ;
scanf ( "%d %d", &cy, &yoj ) ;
yos = cy - yoj ;
if ( yos > 3 )
{

bonus = 2500 ;
printf ( "Bonus = Rs. %d\n", bonus ) ;
}
return 0 ;
}


OUT PUT :
Enter current year and year of joining 2005 2001
Bonus = Rs. 2500

      QUESTION 2
      If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary
and DA = 90% of basic salary. If his salary is either equal to or above Rs.
1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. If the employee's
salary is input through the keyboard write a program to find his gross
salary.

# include <stdio.h>
int main( )
{
float bs, gs, da, hra ;
printf ( "Enter basic salary " ) ;
scanf ( "%f", &bs ) ;
if ( bs < 1500 )
{
hra = bs * 10 / 100 ;
da = bs * 90 / 100 ;
}
else
{
hra = 500 ;
da = bs * 98 / 100 ;
}
gs = bs + hra + da ;
printf ( "gross salary = Rs. %f\n", gs ) ;
return 0 ;
}
 
 OUTPUT:
 Enter basic salary 1700
gross salary = Rs. 3866.000000
 Enter basic salary 700
gross salary = Rs. 1400.000000

   QUESTION 3:
   The marks obtained by a student in 5 different subjects are
input through the keyboard. The student gets a division as per the
following rules:
Percentage above or equal to 60 - First division
Percentage between 50 and 59 - Second division
Percentage between 40 and 49 - Third division
Percentage less than 40 - Fail
Write a program to calculate the division obtained by the student
   
   
   #include <stdio.h>
   int main ()
   {
   int m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,per;
   printf("values of m1,m2,m3,m4,m5");
   scanf("%d %d %d %d %d",&m1,&m2,&m3,&m4,&m5);
   per = (m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5)/500*100;
   if(per>=60)
   printf("FIRST DIVISION ");
   if((per>=50)&&(per<60))
   printf("SECOND DIVISION");
   if((per>=40)&&(per<50))
   printf("THIRD DIVISION");
   if(per<40)
   printf("FAIL");
   return 0;
   }
 OUTPUT :: 
 values of m1,m2,m3,m4,m5
 10 20 30 40 50 
 FAIL

QUESTION 4:
: A company insures its drivers in the following cases:
 If the driver is married.
 If the driver is unmarried, male & above 30 years of age.
 If the driver is unmarried, female & above 25 years of age.
In all other cases, the driver is not insured. If the marital status, sex and
age of the driver are the inputs, write a program to determine whether
the driver should be insured or not.  


#include<stdio.h>
int main ()
{
int age ;
char sex ,ms;
printf ( "Enter age, sex, marital status " ) ;
scanf ( "%d %c %c", &age, &sex, &ms ) ;
if (ms=='M')
printf("the driver should be insured ");
else
{
if (sex=='M')
{ 
if (age>35)
printf("the driver should be insured ");
else
printf("not insured");
}
else
{
if("age>25")
printf("the driver should be insured ");
else
printf("not insured");
}
}
return 0;
}

OUTPUT:

Enter age, sex, marital status 
36 M UM
the driver should be insured     

Enter age, sex, marital status 
26 F UM
the driver should be insured

( ms == 'U' && sex == 'F' && age > 25 ) )
printf ( "Driver should be insured\n" ) ;
else
printf ( "Driver should not be insured\n" ) ;
return 0 ;
}
OUTPUT:
nter age, sex, marital status 18 M M
Driver should be insured
