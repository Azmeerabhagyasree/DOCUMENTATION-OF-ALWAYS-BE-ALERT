QUESTION 1
The current year and the year in which the employee
joined the organization are entered through the keyboard. If the
number of years for which the employee has served the organization is
greater than 3, then a bonus of Rs. 2500/- is given to the employee. If
the years of service are not greater than 3, then the program should do
nothing


# include <stdio.h>
int main( )
{
int bonus, cy, yoj, yos ;
printf ( "Enter current year and year of joining " ) ;
scanf ( "%d %d", &cy, &yoj ) ;
yos = cy - yoj ;
if ( yos > 3 )
{

bonus = 2500 ;
printf ( "Bonus = Rs. %d\n", bonus ) ;
}
return 0 ;
}


OUT PUT :
Enter current year and year of joining 2005 2001
Bonus = Rs. 2500
      
      
      
      QUESTION 2
      If his basic salary is less than Rs. 1500, then HRA = 10% of basic salary
and DA = 90% of basic salary. If his salary is either equal to or above Rs.
1500, then HRA = Rs. 500 and DA = 98% of basic salary. If the employee's
salary is input through the keyboard write a program to find his gross
salary.

# include <stdio.h>
int main( )
{
float bs, gs, da, hra ;
printf ( "Enter basic salary " ) ;
scanf ( "%f", &bs ) ;
if ( bs < 1500 )
{
hra = bs * 10 / 100 ;
da = bs * 90 / 100 ;
}
else
{
hra = 500 ;
da = bs * 98 / 100 ;
}
gs = bs + hra + da ;
printf ( "gross salary = Rs. %f\n", gs ) ;
return 0 ;
}
 
 OUTPUT:
 Enter basic salary 1700
gross salary = Rs. 3866.000000
 Enter basic salary 700
gross salary = Rs. 1400.000000
