# ALWAYS BE ALERT 
   ***Once upon a time there was a lionü¶Å that grew so old that he was unable to kill any prey for his foodüçΩ. So, he said to himself, I must do something to stay my stomach else I will die of starvation.
   
   ***He kept thinking and thinking and at last an idea clicked him. He decided to lie down in the cave pretending to be ill and then who-so-ever will come to inquire about his health, will become his prey. The old lion put his wicked plan into practice and it started working. Many of his well-wishers got killed. But evil is short lived.
   
   ***One day, a foxü¶ä came to visit the ailing lion. As foxes are clever by nature, the fox stood at the mouth of the cave and looked about. His sixth sense worked and he came to know the reality. So, he called out to the lion from outside and said, How are you, sir?
   
   ***The lionü¶Å replied, I am not feeling well at all. But why don‚Äôt you come inside?
   *** Then the foxü¶ä replied, I would love to come in, sir! But on seeing, all foot prints going to your cave and none coming out, I would be foolish enough to come in.
   ***  Saying so, the fox went to alert the other animals.  ***  Moral: Always Keep Your Eyes Open and Stay Alert before Walking in Any Situation.                                     
   
   
   **Thinking_Out_of_the_Box (Creative Thinking):    
    

In a small Italian town, hundreds of years ago, a small business owner owed a large sum of money to a loan-shark. The loan-shark was a very old, unattractive looking guy that just so happened to fancy the business owner‚Äôs daughter.                           

He decided to offer the businessman a deal that would completely wipe out the debt he owed him. However, the catch was that we would only wipe out the debt if he could marry the businessman‚Äôs daughter.                              

Needless to say, this proposal was met with a look of disgust.                       

The loan-shark said that he would place two pebbles into a bag, one white and one black.                            

The daughter would then have to reach into the bag and pick out a pebble. If it was black, the debt would be wiped, but the loan-shark would then marry her. If it was white, the debt would also be wiped, but the daughter wouldn‚Äôt have to marry the loan-shark.                         

Standing on a pebble-strewn path in the businessman‚Äôs garden, the loan-shark bent over and picked up two pebbles.                   

Whilst he was picking them up, the daughter noticed that he‚Äôd picked up two black pebbles and placed them both into the bag.                    

He then asked the daughter to reach into the bag and pick one.                   

The daughter naturally had three choices as to what she could have done:                

Refuse to pick a pebble from the bag.                        
Take both pebbles out of the bag and expose the loan-shark for cheating.                               
Pick a pebble from the bag fully well knowing it was black and sacrifice herself for her father‚Äôs freedom.                               
She drew out a pebble from the bag, and before looking at it ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô dropped it into the midst of the other pebbles. She said to the loan-shark;                  

‚ÄúOh, how clumsy of me. Never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.‚Äù   
Thank you        

The pebble left in the bag is obviously black, and seeing as the loan-shark didn‚Äôt want to be exposed, he had to play along as if the pebble the daughter dropped was white, and clear her father‚Äôs debt.                  

Moral: It‚Äôs always possible to overcome a tough situation throughout of the box thinking, and not give in to the only options you think you have to pick from.
